# Catalogs

## Introduction
As discussed previously, Solodev Cloud provides developers with a wide range of infrastructure that will empower them to create various applications or services and provide a dynamic and enjoyable web experience to their clients. Catalogs provide developers with a collection of applications and services that they can use to build their own customized applications. Developers can share these collections with other users via organizations to facilitate collaboration. 

 

Once developers have built their applications, they can become Sellers and distribute their products for purchase via an application catalog or have them featured in the Solodev Store. Catalogs also provide resellers with the ability to sell existing marketing services to their clients in streamlined packages at a margin. 

 

Catalogs are categorized into three types listed below:

 

**Private Catalogs** – a library that contains a collection of services and applications that can be used by developers to create their own applications. Used in conjunction with organizations, these libraries can be shared privately with other users to facilitate collaboration or provide other users with catalog offerings for their own projects. Developers are also able to use the private catalogs of other users for their own projects – provided that they are members of the users’ organization.

 

**Application Catalogs** – Once their application is ready for deployment to the wider public, developers can monetize their applications by selling them on a private marketplace to their customers or have those same applications whitelisted and featured on the official Solodev Marketplace.

**Service Catalogs** – a library that contains a collection of digital market services that digital advertising agencies can sell to their customers at a margin. Vendors can deploy these services to their customers with minimal configuration – enhancing their clients' digital experience. Learn more about becoming a Solodev Reseller.

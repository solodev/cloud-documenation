# Subscriptions

Subscriptions are shown as cards on the dashboard. Each card displays a thumbnail of the subscription, status, user, when it was launched, billing period, next billing date, and estimated price.

Use the option to search your subscription by name. You can also filter subscriptions by status: **Active** and **Canceled**.

Click the subscription card to be redirected to the subscribed product.

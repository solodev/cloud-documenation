# Purchases

Purchases are shown as cards on the dashboard. Each card displays a thumbnail of the purchase, status, user when it was launched, license type, licenses left, and price.

Use the option to search your purchase by name. You can also filter purchases on status: **Reorder**, **Install Now**, and **Payment Failed**.

Click the purchase card to be redirected to the purchased product.

# API

An API is a way for two or more apps to communicate with each other.

The importance of efficient and reliable APIs cannot be overstated and is why Solodev utilizes Swagger. Swagger is a set of rules (specifications) and tooling to semantically describe APIs using a common language that is readable by both humans and machines. This means the same documentation can be shared with your team while also being used to automate API-dependent processes which is great for testing and debugging API problems. Any API that adheres to the Swagger specs is easy to read, easy to iterate, and easy to consume.

## API Authorization

There are two options for authorization: **Bearer** and **UserApiToken**.

### Bearer Authentication  

Bearer Authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token” the token is a cryptic string usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the authorization header when making requests to protected resources.

Your profile page allows you to update some of your account basics

1. From the left nav you can access screens to edit your email, username, security (password) and API tokens.
2. The main area allows you to update your first and last name, phone number, timezone and title.
3. Any changes made to the above can be saved by clicking the update button.
4. There are two ways to update your profile image. You can choose to upload an image or you can create a custom Avatar with the built-in Ready Player Me avatar generator. Either way, customizing your image will help you to identify among other users, organizations and in the marketplace.
 - To upload an image hover over the existing image and click on the camera icon. Navigate to where your photo is stored and upload (recommended image size of 400x400)

 - To generate an avatar click the blue create avatar button and follow the prompts to generate and apply your new avatar (please note after the last step it takes a few seconds to process)

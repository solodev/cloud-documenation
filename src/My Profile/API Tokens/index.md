# API Tokens

An API token is similar to a password and allows you to authenticate to Dataverse Software APIs to perform actions as you. Many Dataverse Software APIs require the use of an API token.

Existing tokens are listed in the table on the dashboard. Each token is shown with details such as name, the key that can be previewed using the eye icon, and status.

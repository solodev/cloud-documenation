# Deployments

## Overview
In the previous article, we discussed how developers can leverage containers to deploy applications, services, and websites at light speed and manage them all in one place with minimal configuration. Developers who link their AWS account to Solodev Cloud can leverage the power of deployments and launch CloudFormation applications in very little time. Deployments are ideal for Enterprise sys-admins interested in high availability server instances and managing single tenant applications. In addition to the granular permissions offered by Solodev Cloud, administrators can enjoy the added security provided by AWS Identity Access Management (IAM) to further control access to resources.   

## Considerations and advantages
In addition to the aforementioned advantages, deployments allow developers to launch a wide variety of applications with EC2 instances, load balancers, and autoscaling. They can also manage manage server configurations with AWS OpsWorks that controls Chef recipes..

 

Since the deployments offered by Solodev tend to differ in technical complexity, Solodev recommends that users choose their deployments based on project requirements and the scale of their operation. For example, if a developer and their organization would like to make a lifestyle blog to accompany their brand, Solodev CMS Professional Edition is an optimal solution for their needs. Descriptions of the Solodev deployments and links to their installation instructions are provided below.

 

## Enterprise options
Solodev CMS Professional Edition -- Users are able to build a professional-grade websites, apps, or portals with the power of Solodev, backed by PHP, Apache Mongo and more -- all on a single EC2 instance with an external Amazon RDS MySQL database that can be managed by AWS Opsworks.

Solodev CMS Enterprise Edition -- Quickly and easily deploy Solodev Enterprise to build websites, portals or applications that can handle any amount of traffic, leveraging multiple geographic data centers for unmatched redundancy, security and scalability. 

Solodev Personalize -- Automate the process of deploying event trackers. 

IoT -- manage licenses, updates, and deploy code through serverless lambda calls.

## Add Deployments

Users can add deployments to any of their organizations. Deployments include CMS platforms such as Solodev CMS Enterprise or Professional Editions, but they can also include other applications that are launched using Amazon CloudFormation. Available apps will be featured in the Deployments section of Solodev Cloud.

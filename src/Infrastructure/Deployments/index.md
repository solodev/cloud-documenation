### Cloud 

#### AI/ML

##### Personalize


Powered by AWS, Solodev provides a cloud-based recommendation engine for websites and apps that can be deployed quickly, so you can start serving AI-driven product recommendations across your digital experiences, including eCommerce stores, blogs, streaming video, and more.

A fully-managed solution, Solodev taps the power of Amazon Personalize – the same engine used by Amazon.com – to surface relevant recommendations based on real-time user interactions. Leveraging powerful AI from AWS, Solodev Personalize goes beyond the rigid, static, rule-based recommendation systems and automatically trains, tunes, and deploys custom machine learning models to deliver recommendations to customers across industries, from retail to media and beyond.

Product option:

- Professional (2.950 $/month)

#### Containers

##### Chart Museum

To find out what is Chart Museum, you have to learn what is Helm. This is the first application package manager running atop Kubernetes. It allows users to describe the application structure through convenient Helm Charts, and manage it with simple commands. It’s a huge shift in the way the server-side applications are defined, stored, and managed.

Chart Museum is an open-source Helm Chart Repository written in Go (Golang) with support for cloud storage backends, including Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, Alibaba Cloud OSS Storage, and Openstack Object Storage. It is used to store and serve Helm Charts to deploy apps to a Kubernetes cluster. ChartMuseum performs the task of being a Chart Management tool. When Charts are uploaded to a cloud store, ChartMuseum acts like a binary to fetch and maintain the Chart information.

#### Infrastructure

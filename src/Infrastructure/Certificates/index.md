## About Certificates

Website security certificate is a digital stamp of approval from an industry-trusted third party known as a certificate authority (CA). More specifically, it’s a digital file containing information that’s issued by a CA that indicates that the website is secured using an encrypted connection.

With a website security certificate, users can be confident that connection is made to the right, official server for the website that he wants to visit (not fake one). Moreover nobody can intercept data they send to the website and use it for nefarious purposes.

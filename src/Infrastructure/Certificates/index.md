## What is a SSL/TLS Certificate? 

Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates, commonly know as SSL or digital certicates, are the foundation of a safe and secure internet. TLS/SSL certificates secure internet connections by encrypting data transmitted between your browser, the website you're visiting, and the web server -- ensuring that data flows privately without modifications, loss, or theft. They also authenticate the identity of the website that owns the certificate. TLS/SSL certificates are the standard used by all major web browsers to ensure the safest internet experience for users. Websites and content secured by TTL/SSL certificates are trusted most by internet users because they protect private information transferred to and from websites. TLS/SSL certificates serve as an identity protection measure for online brands and a security measure for companies transmitting private data online. Solodev recommends that content creators use TLS/SSL certificates to validate their brand identity and secure their web content.

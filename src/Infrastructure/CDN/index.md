# Content Delivery Networks

Deliver web content at light speed with content delivery networks. 

--- 


## What is a content delivery network? 

A content delivery network, henceforth CDN, is a system of distributed servers that deliver webpages and other Web content relative to the enduser's geographic location, the origin of the website, and a content delivery server. At itâ€™s core, a CDN is a caching systems for website content, pushing it to the edge of a separate network, and negating the server latency -- resulting in higher quality network connections. A properly configured CDN may also help protect websites against some common malicious attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks. As a Solodev Cloud user, you may want to use a CDN to help your page or web content load more quickly.

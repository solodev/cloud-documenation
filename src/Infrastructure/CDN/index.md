# Content Delivery Networks

Deliver web content at light speed with content delivery networks. 

--- 


## What is a content delivery network? 

A content delivery network, henceforth CDN, is a system of distributed servers that deliver webpages and other Web content relative to the enduser's geographic location, the origin of the website, and a content delivery server. CDNs allow for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. The popularity of CDN services continues to grow, as more web traffic is served through CDNs, including traffic from major sites like Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon. At its core, a CDN caches web content by pushing to the edge of a seperate network, which improves website peformance. A properly configured CDN may also help protect websites against some common malicious attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks. Solodev recommends using CDNs to reduce hosting bandwith, prevent interruptions in service, and improve security.

# Pages

The pages page provides a view of your existing pages as well as the option to add a new page.

Existing pages are listed in the table on the dashboard. Each page is shown with details such as name, site, when it was modified, and by whom.

Find the page by typing its name in the search field. Filter pages on page type and by the site.

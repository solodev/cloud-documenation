# Page Details

The page details page gives you a comprehensive overview of your page with convenient access to edits and functionality.

Your page detail utilizes our Page Studio editor. It has robust built-in drag-and-drop WYSIWYG editing functionality as well as the option to toggle to edit source directly.

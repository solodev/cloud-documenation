## Types of Sites
There are three types of sites to choose from when adding a new site.

### CMS (Content Management System)
A CMS site is website that is built upon and managed by a CMS. Pages are generated dynamically and content can be customized to end users. There are several available tiers of Solodev CMS as well as other CMS industry leaders such as Wordpress available from the Solodev Marketplace. 

### Static
A static website uses server-side rendering to serve pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a web browser. Static sites enable you to decouple your content repository and front-end interface, giving you greater flexibility in how your content is served with the added benefit of minimal cost. Static sites launched through Solodev can be edited with our Page Studio WYSIWYG editor.

### External

There are prerequisites required to add a new site. These prerequisites vary depending on site type and are noted with each respective input field.

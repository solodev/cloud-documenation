## Step 1: Pick a Type

There are three types of sites to choose from when adding a new site.

**CMS:** A CMS (Content Management System) lets your team create pages, build websites, publish content dynamically, and utilize data modules to streamline your content operations. With a CMS, you can manage users and groups with permissions on a site or even a page level, allowing you to control and collaborate with your team on digital experiences. There are several CMS options to choose from in Solodev Cloud, including Solodev CMS and WordPress.

**Static:** A static website uses server-side rendering to push pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a web browser. Static sites decouple your content repository from your front-end interface, giving you greater flexibility with minimal cost to host and maintain. Sites launched with Solodev Static can be built and managed using our simple <a href="/pages/pages/read/">drag-and-drop editor</a>.

**External:** In addition to launching a CMS or a static site via Solodev Cloud, you can connect an external site and manage your name, domain, login, and other variables within your Solodev Cloud account.

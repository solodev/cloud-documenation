!!!Note:
You can choose from the 3 site types:

**[CMS:](https://cloud.solodev.net/pages/sites/add-site/#cms)** A CMS (Content Management System) let us create pages, build websites, publish content dynamically, and utilize data modules to streamline content operations. With a CMS, manage users and groups with permissions on a site or even a page level, allowing control and collaboration with the team on digital experiences. There are several CMS options to choose from in Solodev Cloud, including Solodev CMS and WordPress.

**[Static:](https://cloud.solodev.net/pages/sites/add-site/#static)** A static website uses server-side rendering to push pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a web browser. Static sites decouple the content repository from the front-end interface, giving greater flexibility with minimal cost to host and maintain. Sites launched with Solodev Static can be built and managed using our simple drag-and-drop editor.

**[External:](https://cloud.solodev.net/pages/sites/add-site/#external)** In addition to launching a CMS or a static site via Solodev Cloud, there is an option to connect an external site and manage the name, domain, login, and other variables within the Solodev Cloud account.

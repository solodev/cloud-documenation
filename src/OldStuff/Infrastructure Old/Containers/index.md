# Containers 

Containers provides developers with a lightweight method of launching multiple applications and services on a public or private cluster. Containers allow developers to host and deploy various websites and apps on a variety of systems reliably and consistently. For example, containers allow you to deploy an instance of Solodev CMS for your production site and another instance for testing and development. Extend the power of containerized applications with the help of add-ons that are categorized for Solodev CMS: Themes, Applications, and Modules. With the added ability to set and manage permissions, administrators can enjoy enhanced security and provide better control over mission critical applications or tasks.

- Increased portability: Applications running in containers can be easily deployed to different operating systems or hardware platforms. 

- Consistent operations: Containerized applications run the same regardless of where they are deployed.

- Increased efficiency: Rapidly deploy, scale, or patch applications

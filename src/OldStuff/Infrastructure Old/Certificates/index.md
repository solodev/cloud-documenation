## What is a SSL & TLS Certificate? 

Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates, commonly know as SSL or digital certicates, are the foundation of a safe and secure internet. SSL & TLS certificates secure internet connections by encrypting data transmitted between your browser, the website you're visiting, and the web server -- ensuring that data flows privately without modifications, loss, or theft. They also authenticate the identity of the website that owns the certificate. SSL& TLS certificates are the standard used by all major web browsers to ensure the safest internet experience for users. Websites and content secured by SSL & TLS certificates are trusted most by internet users because they protect private information transmitted over the internet. To use HTTPS with your domain, SSL & TLS must be installed on your website. If certificates are not installed on your website, the web browser will alert end users with a "Not Secure" warning. Certifcates are provided by your web hosting provider or requested from appropriate certificate authorities. SSL & TLS certificates serve as an identity protection measure for online brands and a security measure for companies transmitting private data online. SSL & TLS certificates may need to be renewed periodically. Solodev recommends that content creators use SSL & TLS certificates to validate their brand identity and secure their web content.

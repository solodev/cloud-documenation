When logging in to your account (or creating a new account), you will land in your default personal developer dashboard. Your user is essentially your own organization and the admin of all things Solodev Cloud. Your personal developer space has the functionality to create, test and launch your individual projects. You will also be able to add organizations, users, groups and permissions to create collaborative efforts.

## Developer Workspace



Below is a general overview of the developer workspace. In general, the workspace will remain in a format similar to the above with slight variances depending on which part you are in.

1. Your custom image/avatar/logo which can be created and edited in the profile section
2. Toggle between your developer account and your organization(s)
3. The main left nav. Nav options will change depending upon your location, but there will always be left nav options and a back/return option
4. Click on the link to go to your organizations dashboard or click on one of the organization icons to go directly to that account
5. Refer a friend to sign up for Solodev and earn referral perks
6. Here you can log out of your account and manage your user profile by editing your image, your username, your email, password, etc.
7. This is your general workspace and most of your work will take place in this portion of the screen
8. On many screens there will be options for you in the top right corner of your workspace, including drop downs, filters and modal calls

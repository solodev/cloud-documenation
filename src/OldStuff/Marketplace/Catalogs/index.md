# Catalogs

Solodev Cloud provides a wide range of infrastructure that will empower you to create various applications or services and provide a dynamic and enjoyable web experience to your clients. Catalogs provide you with a collection of applications and services that you can use to build your own customized applications. Share these collections with other users via organizations to facilitate collaboration.

After building your applications, you can become a Seller and distribute your products for purchase via an application catalog or have them featured in the Solodev Store. Catalogs also provide resellers with the ability to sell existing marketing services to their clients in streamlined packages at a margin. 

 

Catalogs are categorized into three types listed below:

 

**Private Catalogs:** a library that contains a collection of services and applications that you can use to create your own applications. Used in conjunction with organizations, these libraries can be shared privately with other users to facilitate collaboration or provide others with catalog offerings for their own projects. Additionally, you are able to use the private catalogs of other users for your own projects.

 

**Application Catalogs:** Once your application is ready for deployment to the wider public, you can monetize your applications by selling them on a private marketplace to your customers or have those same applications whitelisted and featured on the official Solodev Marketplace.

**Service Catalogs:** a library that contains a collection of digital market services that digital advertising agencies can sell to their customers at a margin. Vendors can deploy these services to their customers with minimal configuration â€“ enhancing their clients' digital experience. Learn more about becoming a Solodev Reseller.

## Account Structure

Your Solodev account is structured in three tiers: Developer (Admin), Organizations, and Users.

<a href="../../images/cloud-dev-org-group-users.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../../images/cloud-dev-org-group-users.jpg" style="margin: auto; display: block" width="700" height="700"></a>

**Developer**

When logging in to your account (or creating a new account) you will open your default personal developer dashboard. Your developer user is the root admin for everything Solodev Cloud (see illustration above). Your developer space has the functionality to create, test, and launch your projects. You will also be able to add organizations, users, groups, and permissions to create collaborative efforts.

**Organizations**

Organizations are shared accounts that facilitate collaboration. As an admin, you can generate as many organizations as you wish. Organizations allow you to associate deployments, clusters, catalogs, and websites within your organization and enjoy administrative privileges for these items. They also allow you to manage member access to the organization's data and projects with sophisticated security features such as granular permissions.

**Users and Groups**

In addition to associating deployments, clusters, catalogs, services, and websites with their organization, administrators can use organizations to facilitate cross-collaboration across many projects by inviting users. Users can be organized via groups and permissions. Administrators can manage member access to organizational data with sophisticated security features such as granular permissions. You can mirror your organization’s actual hierarchy to ensure each user can access and use only what they should.

This is the default plan you will enroll in upon account creation.

This plan includes everything in the developer plan plus the ability to sell your custom apps on your dedicated profile page. You can also sell other developers’ apps and add your apps to the Solodev Marketplace.

**Reseller**

This plan includes all of the above plus the ability to create your custom catalog of pre-built apps and containers to resell. You can also stack your catalog with third-party apps from the marketplace and offer additional support or agency consulting services.

## How to sell on the Marketplace

Only organizations can become a seller (or re-seller) in Solodev Cloud. Therefore, to sell your apps or resell apps you will need to [create an organization](https://cloud.solodev.net/organizations/) if you have not done so already. Once you have created your organization, please access it and click the “become a galactic seller” card from the home dashboard

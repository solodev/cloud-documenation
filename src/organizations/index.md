# Organizations

Organizations are shared accounts that facilitate collaboration. As an admin, you can generate as many organizations as you wish. Organizations allow you to associate deployments, clusters, catalogs, and websites within your organization and enjoy administrative privileges for these items. They also allow you to manage member access to the organization's data and projects with sophisticated security features such as granular permissions.

To start building your organization, you need to use the organization's page.

The organizations' page provides an overview of your existing organizations as well as the option to add a new organization.

# Organizations

Organizations are shared accounts that facilitate collaboration. As an admin, you can generate as many organizations as you wish. Organizations allow you to associate deployments, clusters, catalogs and websites within your organization and enjoy administrative privileges for these items. They also allow you to manage member access to the organization's data and projects with sophisticated security features such as granular permissions.

About your organizations dashboard:

1. Your main workspace will show cards for all of your existing organizations which are also clickable to access the organization
2. The drop-down menu under your avatar will also display and take you to an existing organization
3. The icons on the left will also take you to their corresponding organization
4. Click on the add organization card to add a new organization to your account

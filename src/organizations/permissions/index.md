# Organization Permissions

Permissions allow you to manage access for users. They are found and applicable in almost all cloud elements, like services, pages, sites, containers, deployments, CDN etc. 

1. Start typing the name of an existing user to select that user
2. Choose the role you’d like to assign the user: view, editor, admin
3. Click the plus button to grant the user permissions and add them to the list
4. This is a list showing all the users and their permissions (you can delete a user’s permissions by clicking the trash can icon)
5. Adjust each user’s permissions with the drop-down menu
6. Click the blue submit button to save and apply your changes

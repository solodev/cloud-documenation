# Groups

Group administrators can manage member access to organizational data with sophisticated security features such as granular permissions. You can mirror your actual organizationâ€™s hierarchy to ensure each user is able to access and use only what they should.

The groups home page:

1. Has a clickable list of your groups to open their detail page
2. Allows you to add a new group

# Permissions

Permissions are a powerful tool that allows you to manage access for users and groups. User and group permissions can range from broad-scope team access to the fine granularity of single-user access to one single element. Permission modals exist for almost all cloud elements to help you organize and manage your organization and team(s).

## Add Permissions

### Step 1: Folders

Expand each folder to add permissions to only parts of the section.

### Step 2: Role

Select the role you would like to apply to the chosen user or group. There are three options to choose from:

- **View:** The view role will only allow the chosen user or group the ability to see this item.
- **Editor:** The editor role will enable the chosen user or group the ability to see and edit this item.
- **Admin:** The admin role enables the chosen user or group the ability to see, edit and manage this item. This permission allows the ability to add or remove users and groups as well as the ability to modify or delete the entity.

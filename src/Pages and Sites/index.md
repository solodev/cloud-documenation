## About Pages and Sites

What is the difference between page and site? The webpage is a single document on the web using a unique URL, while a website is a collection of multiple webpages in which information on a related topic or another subject is linked together under the same domain address.

You will be able to create page and site from the level of developer account, but from the organization level as well.

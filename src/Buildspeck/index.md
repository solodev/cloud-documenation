# Buildspeck

Solodev Buildspec is a specialized set of build commands and settings for creating custom forms. With Buildspec, users can define form fields, capture form answers, and provide values for specific applications. It utilizes clear and simple YAML syntax and is being used in various places in the Solodev Cloud.

For example, users with a Marketplace Seller subscription can use Buildspec to customize their forms – allowing them to define the questions they need to ask buyers when configuring services in the Soldev Store. They can also use Buildspec to collect and pass values for various parameters in AWS CloudFormation Templates.

Anywhere that questions need to be asked – or answers provided – Buildspec can be used to customize a form and capture the necessary information.

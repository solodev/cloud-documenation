# Organizations

Organizations are shared accounts that facilitate collaboration. As am admin, you can generate as many organizations as you wish.  across many projects. Organizations allow you to associate deployments, clusters, catalogs and websites within your organization and enjoy administrative privileges for these items. They also allow you to manage member access to the organization's data and projects with sophisticated security features such as granular permissions.

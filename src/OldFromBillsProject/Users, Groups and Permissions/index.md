# Users, Groups and Permissions

In addition to associating deployments, clusters, catalogs, services and website with their organization, administrators can use organizations to facilitate cross collaboration across many projects by inviting users. With Solodev Users and Groups administrators can manage member access to organizational data with sophisticated security features such as granular permissions. You can mirror your actual organizationâ€™s hierarchy to ensure each user is able to access and use only what they should.

***Please Note:** Users and groups are only available within an organization.*

## About Containers

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Then it can be run anywhere - on a PC, in a traditional IT environment or in the cloud.

Containers use a kind of operating system (OS) virtualization, in which the operating system functions are used to separate processes and control CPU resources, operating memory and mass memory for which these processes have access.

Containers are small, fast, and portable because, unlike a virtual machine, they don't need to include the guest operating system in each instance, and instead can use the host operating system's features and resources.

You can launch 2 containers on our Solodev Cloud. These are CMS or Wordpress.

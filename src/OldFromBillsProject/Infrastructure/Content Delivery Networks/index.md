# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

## About CDN

A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that accelerate webpage loading for data-heavy applications. Users get lower latency—the time it takes to load the first byte of the file—and higher data transfer rates.

## Adding CDN

In section Infrastructure, CDN is part of Settings in the left side of the page. Click on that.
There you have CDN list and option “Add CDN”.

- Click Add.

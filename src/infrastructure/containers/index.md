# Containers

A container is a software unit that packages up code and all its dependencies, allowing applications to run quickly and reliably from one computing environment to anotherâ€¦on a PC, in a traditional IT environment or in the cloud.

Containers are small, fast, and portable because, unlike a virtual machine, they don't need to include the guest operating system in each instance, and instead can use the host operating system's features and resources.

On the containers page you will see:

1. Cards showing all your containers and their status (you can click on each card to open that container directly)
2. You can add a container by clicking on the add container card
3. Click the cluster drop-down to filter by cluster

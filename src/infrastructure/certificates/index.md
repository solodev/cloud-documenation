# Certificates

A website security certificate is a digital stamp of approval from an industry-trusted third party known as a certificate authority (CA). More specifically, it’s a digital file containing information that’s issued by a CA that indicates that the website is secured using an encrypted connection.

With a website security certificate users can be confident that their connection is safe and secure to the official server of the website that they want to visit.

On the certificates page, you can easily manage your certificates.

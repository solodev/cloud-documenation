# Certificates

A website security certificate is a digital stamp of approval from an industry-trusted third party known as a certificate authority (CA). More specifically, it’s a digital file containing information that’s issued by a CA that indicates that the website is secured using an encrypted connection.

With a website security certificate users can be confident that their connection is safe and secure to the official server for the website that they want to visit.

# Clusters

A cluster is a set of nodes that run containerized applications. Containerizing applications packages an app with its dependences and some necessary services. They are more lightweight and flexible than virtual machines. A cluster can contain many pods, related or unrelated [and] grouped under the tight logical borders called namespaces.

On the clusters page you will see:

1. Cards showing all your clusters and their status (you can click on each card to open that cluster directly)
2. You can add a cluster by clicking on the add cluster card
3. Click the provider drop-down to filter your clusters by provider

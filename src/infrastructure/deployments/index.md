# Deployments  

Deployments are ideal for high-availability server instances and managing single-tenant applications. Deployments allow you to launch a wide variety of applications with EC2 instances, load balancers, and autoscaling.

Manage deployments that are presented in the form of cards showing all their status. Click on each card to open the deployment directly.

Click the provider drop-down to filter by provider.

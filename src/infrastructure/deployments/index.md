# Deployments

Deployments are ideal for high availability server instances and managing single tenant applications. Deployments allow you to launch a wide variety of applications with EC2 instances, load balancers, and autoscaling.

On the deployments page you will see:

1. Cards showing all your deployments and their status (you can click on each card to open that deployment directly)
2. You can add a deployment by clicking on the add container card
3. Click the provider drop-down to filter by provider

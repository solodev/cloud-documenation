# Deployment Overview

The Deployment Overview page provides you with the ability to manage your deployments. Do it by updating details, modifying permissions for members or upgrading your deployment version.

!!!Note:
The specificity of each product is different, therefore the options that are available after opening the deployment card differ. Universal options that appear for almost every deployment are **Update**, **Permissions**, and **Upgrade**.

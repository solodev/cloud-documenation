# CDN

A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that accelerate webpage loading for data-heavy applications. Users get lower latency—the time it takes to load the first byte of the file—and higher data transfer rates.

Manage easily your CDNs on the CDN page. CDNs are presented in the form of a table with the details such as origins, certificates, and CDN creator. You can open the CDN page by clicking it.

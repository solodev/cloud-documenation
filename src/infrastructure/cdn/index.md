# CDN

A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that accelerate webpage loading for data-heavy applications. Users get lower latency—the time it takes to load the first byte of the file—and higher data transfer rates.

On the CDN page, you can easily manage your CDNs.

1. Click on any CDN from the list to open that CDN
2. Click on the blue button to add a new CDN

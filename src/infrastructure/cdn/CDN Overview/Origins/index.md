# Origins

A CDN topology distinguishes between your own origin servers and the on-edge servers of your CDN provider. The former contains the original version of your website while the latter hosts cached versions of some of its content.

CDN Origins are presented in the form of a table with the details such as origins, certificates, and CDN creator.

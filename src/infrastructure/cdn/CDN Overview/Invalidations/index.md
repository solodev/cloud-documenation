# Invalidations

After an object is cached, it normally remains in the cache until it expires or is evicted to make room for new content. You control the expiration time through standard HTTP headers. You might want to remove an object from the cache prior to its normal expiration time.

CDN Invalidations are presented in the form of a table with the details such as Description, Status, Date of Creation, and the CDN creator. Open the CDN Invalidation page by clicking it.
